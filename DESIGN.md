# Final Project Markdown
For my final project, I created an HTML Portfolio Website. This project took a lot of trial and error and some outside research. 
I started by making a new repository and naming it ajfinalport.github.io and I added a readme file with that text to make sure the website was routed correctly so it opened. 
I then thought about how I wanted my website formatted. I wanted there to be a header and an introduction paragraph. I then want to make a gallery of my songs that people can easily listen to. 
I also wanna show my sound design and any other stuff I have made. 

I started by making the header. I made it so the background color was red and put the font as times new roman. 

I then added a subheader that listed my job skills. However, I wanted to change it to be in italics so I looked it up on the w3schools.com website. This website was the main resource I used, it has so much helpful information. 

Next, I decided I wanted to upload an image to the header.

I watched this youtube video which helped me to better understand how to use github to make my site and upload my photos. 

So I uploaded an "images" folder that had the picture I wanted to use. 

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp

I looked up on the w3schools website about putting photos in HTML. 

**<img src="saxy.JPG" alt="aj playing sax">**

I entered this line of code however nothing showed up because I had the path wrong and had to change it to images/saxy.JPG

The photo was also really big and not centered so I had to figure out how to change that. 

I then changed the width of the image to 50% and added a margin-top, margin-left, and margin-right details which I read about on the w3schools.com website. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp
This helped me to get the photo centered. I had to try a few different numbers till I got it where I wanted it to be. I also added a solid black border around the photo.

Next, I decided to add an "about me section" next to the photo. I made another header in the body section and created the code in the top part. I tried to use "float" to try and padding to move it to where I wanted it to be however I was not able to get it to do what I wanted. 

I then went back to the w3schools website and read about grid containers and used that. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_container.asp 
      
        **.grid-container {**
            **display: grid;**
            **grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;**
            **max-width: 800px;**
            **margin: 20px auto 0;**
            **align-items: center;**

I had to make a few adjustments to the image code to get everything realigned and had to add the grid container to the body.
