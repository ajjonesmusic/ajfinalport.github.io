# Final Project Markdown
For my final project, I created an HTML Portfolio Website. This project took a lot of trial and error and some outside research. 
I started by making a new repository and naming it ajfinalport.github.io and I added a readme file with that text to make sure the website was routed correctly so it opened. 
I then thought about how I wanted my website formatted. I wanted there to be a header and an introduction paragraph. I then want to make a gallery of my songs that people can easily listen to. 
I also wanna show my sound design and any other stuff I have made. 

I started by making the header. I made it so the background color was red and put the font as times new roman. 
I then added a subheader that listed my job skills. However, I wanted to change it to be in italics so I looked it up on the w3schools.com website. This website was the main resource I used, it has so much helpful information. 
Next, I decided I wanted to upload an image to the header.

I watched this youtube video which helped me to better understand how to use github to make my site and upload my photos. 
So I uploaded an "images" folder that had the picture I wanted to use.

I looked up on the w3schools website about putting photos in HTML.
